Finding an ML model that is accurate on unobserved data requires engineers to go through a lengthy process and go through multiple steps to construct it. This project will demonstrate how to use the PyCaret module to identify the optimal model. We can forecast the quality of the bike data set using a multi-class classification system.

This session has covered the entire machine learning pipeline, including data import, preprocessing, model training, adjusting hyper parameters, prediction, and model saving for later use. We were able to do each of these tasks in under ten commands by using commands like create model(), tune model(), and compare models that are naturally constructed and simple to remember. To repeat the entire experiment, a lot more lines of code would have been needed if PyCaret hadn't been used.
